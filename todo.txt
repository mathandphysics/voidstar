- implement frame buffers (also in openglrenderer)
	- implement bloom as a postprocessing effect
		- hook up imgui to bloom and play with the art direction
	- make the "view window" its own imgui pane using frame buffers?

- improve accretion disk
	- add darkening gradient toward outer part of ring
		- implement temperature-related colouring.
		- implement doppler shift
	- try to achieve a gas-looking effect?
		- give the ring thickness?
	- maybe switch to a different texture (wood?)

- add rk4 (or adaptive rk4/5) integration
	- add binary search?  to find where intersects y=0 plane when y-value changes of test photon
		- this should make it cheaper to run the simulation even though each integration step is more expensive.

- switch to adm (3+1) formalism?
	- this allows much simpler time handling and makes it trivial to take photon travel time into account
	- also makes it simpler to implement kerr metric, though need to figure out how to go from metric to 3+1 formalism...

- somehow make openglrenderer a submodule of void*?
	- some files must be different though.  (e.g. application.cpp)
